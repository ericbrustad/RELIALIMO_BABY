# Attachment Templates

This folder will hold HTML templates for reservation attachment titles.

- Filenames are generated by slugifying the title (lowercase, spaces -> '-', alphanumerics only).
- Example title "Passenger Welcome" -> `passenger-welcome.html`.
- You can edit the template files later; runtime content per reservation is saved separately (localStorage or Supabase).

Integration:
- Use HtmlAttachmentService.registerTitles(["Your Title"]) to create/track mappings.
- The actual reservation content is saved via persistAttachment(reservationId, title, html).
